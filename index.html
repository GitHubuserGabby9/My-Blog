            <p class="text-muted" >Grand Canyon is a very good place to travel for vacation! Wonderful views and nice trails. If you just randomly take a photo, it will look good. At night, you can see thousand of stars so clearly! Its to bad that the phone cannot see the stars, otherwise I would have taken photos of them. The only downside is the hotel. The wifi is very bad and it is very loud during the night because of the mini fridge. Even when we remove the mini fridge's plug, it is still loud for some reason. But fortunately, it is worth it because you can even see so many mule deer on your way out!</p>

<p>The movie is exellent! I love it! The plot is (spoiler alert) that there is this magical family called the Madrigals and each person has a power. They all live in a magical house becuase of a candle. The candle is a forever burning magical flame and is the source of all the magic. When Mirabel (the only one without a power) sees cracks, she starts to worry about the candle. Then she finds her long lost uncle, who gives her a vision about the future. She finds out the the fate of the candle and the magic is up to her to save. She tries to save the candle but it burns out. Then, the town and her family help to rebuild their home without magic. Her uncle hands her a doornob with an M on it but when she puts it on the front door, the house comes back to live! Everyone's powers return and theyare happy. The movie's plot was really good but the songs were even better. They are so catchy and get stuck in your head! You HAVE to watch it!</p>
